# Prototype

This Repo contains the prototype for the GSOC project.

# Code-Editor
Acts as the Front-end for sending the requests to the Proxy.

# Orchaestra
Acts as a Proxy between the front-end and sample-Project.

# express-mongo
Here I have taken this sample project. But you can modify the route.js in Orachaestra  according to your config.
